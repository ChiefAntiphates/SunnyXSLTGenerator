ASSINGING ALL TAGS A MAPPING VALUE
-----------------------

Upon entering this screen all tags will be red and have a 
"Select Mapping Value" button next to each of them.

For each of these tags, you must click on this button and
complete the instructions shown. This will turn the tag
green.

Once all tags are green you may proceed to the next stage.



If you have a BRD available, the paths of the mapping 
values will be shown once you select them. If the path 
appears incorrect, simply click the button again to 
reselect the mapping value.
