SELECTING THE CORRECT TAG
-----------------------

Here, the system is asking you to select the correct tag/attribute
from the input file that maps to the output tag displated.

Once located, simply highlight the appropriate tag/attribute and
click "Go!".

Please ensure to only select one tag/attribute at a time.



If you do not have a BRD available or are unsure, the system has 
provided the value of the first instance of the tag for you to
look for.

For example if the value given is "foo" and the following tags
are available:
	
		<tag_one>bar</tag_one>
		<tag_two attr="foo" red="egg"/>
		<tag_three>rod</tag_three>
		
You should highlight only the word "attr".



Another example is if the value given is "iron" and the following tags
are available:
	
		<tag_one>spider</tag_one>
		<tag_two red_her="super" attr="bat"/>
		<tag_three>iron</tag_three>
		
You should highlight only the word "tag_three".
