# SunnyXSLTGenerator

Part of my final year project for university.

A small application that can be used to generate an XSLT file, given an example input XML file and an example output file. Target file types include xml, txt and csv.


GENERATING AN XSLT FILE
-----------------------

Ensure that "Generate XSLT File" is displayed above the "Begin Transform" button.
If this is not the case, switch to generate mode using the "Select Mode" help 
menu.

Generating an XSLT file will generate an XSLT stylesheet that can be used to
transform XML files into different files or formats.

Click the "Select Template Input File" button to select the source XML file that 
is to be transformed by XSLT.

Click the "Select Template Output File" button to select what the desired output
file from the transformation should be. The file type could be (.xml), (.txt),
or (.csv).




EXECUTING AN XSLT TRANSFORM
---------------------------

Ensure that "Execute XSLT File" is displayed above the "Begin Execution" button.
If this is not the case, switch to execute mode using the "Select Mode" help 
menu.

Click the "Select Input File" button to select the source XML file that is to 
be transformed by XSLT.

Click the "Select XSLT File" button to select the XSLT file that will be used
to transform the source file. Or, click the "Select Most Recent" button to
automatically select the most recently generated XSLT file by the Generator.
